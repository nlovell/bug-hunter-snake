# Bug Hunting

A Snake-Like game for the Bug Hunter community. Cobbled together during a voice chat with several friends - still needs a lot of work to be functional or even good.


## Notes

### Power-ups

#### Magic 8

Magic 8 can only appear 8 times in a game.

 Maybe the magic 8 could give you a random effect (so if there’s a list of effects everything could give you the magic eight will randomly give you one?) but that might be too complicated

- Ask again later.
- Better not tell you now.
