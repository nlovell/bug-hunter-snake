# Bug Hunting

A Snake-Like game for the Bug Hunter community.


## Initial Draft

### Power-ups

#### Magic 8

Magic 8 can only appear 8 times in a game.

 Maybe the magic 8 could give you a random effect (so if there’s a list of effects everything could give you the magic eight will randomly give you one?) but that might be too complicated


Random Splash Text include:

- As I see it, yes.
- Ask again later.
- Better not tell you now.
- Cannot predict now.
- Concentrate and ask again.
- Don’t count on it.
- It is certain.
- It is decidedly so.
- Most likely.
- My reply is no.
- My sources say no.
- Outlook not so good.
- **It looks great**
- Reply hazy, try again.
- Signs point to yes.
- Very doubtful.
- Without a doubt.
- Yes.
- Yes – definitely.
- You may rely on it.


 magic 8 ball luck lmao
 then the magic 8 ball gives you 8 more points
 which means 8 more tails

#### Sweet Nothing
More Oreos appear on-screen


#### Hershey

Hershey ups the gamespeed by 1 (sugar!)

### Food Types

- Pebbles
- Pancakes
- Oreos
- Apples



 toddler powerup speeds you up and cosy astro powerup slows you down
 

 I guess we could include some items with negative effects too
 a paddle which makes you go backwards :joy:
maybe the caterbug should eat pebbles and pancakes-

 There could even be a sweet nothing powerup that makes more Oreos appear on screen or something
